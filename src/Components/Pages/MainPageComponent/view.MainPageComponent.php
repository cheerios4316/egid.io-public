                I am a <?= $this->getYearsOld() ?> years old web developer from Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹, currently based in Pisa.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a Technical High School Diploma in Computer Science and I've worked in the field for 3 years now.
            </p>
            <p>
                My hobbies â€“ aside from coding â€“ include playing music, cooking good food, and playing old PC games.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm strongly focused on PHP but I have experience with a wide range of languages and technologies: I worked with PHP (vanilla and Symfony), Node (both FE and BE, using technologies such as Express, NestJS, React + Next, as well as vanilla JS), SQL and even some .NET for building Windows tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                On this page you can see a bunch of stuff I'm proud of: pasta with potatoes, some bread I baked, and the Dumpsterfire framework ðŸ”¥
