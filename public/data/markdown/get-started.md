## **Welcome!**
This is the official documentation for the Dumpsterfire framework. \

These are the projects that make Dumpsterfire work: \

[dumpsterfire-pages](https://github.com/cheerios4316/dumpsterfire-pages) | base package \
[poteriforti](https://github.com/cheerios4316/poteriforti) | data source for the project initialization script\
[create-dumpsterfire-app](https://github.com/cheerios4316/create-dumpsterfire-app) | project initialization script

This documentation is still work in progress. If any crucial piece of information is missing, feel free to tell me about it.

### **1. Get started**

Dumpsterfire only requires two components installed on your machine to be able to function:
- Docker Compose
- Node and NPM

Dumpsterfire is meant to run on Docker, and it is not ready to run on bare metal just yet.

The steps to fire up a Dumpsterfire project are as follows:
1. Run the script: `npx create-dumpsterfire-app`
2. Attach a shell to the container and run `npm run project:setup`
3. Every time you need to run `npm` or `composer` commands, do so through the Docker shell
4. If you want, check out the sample project. Otherwise, run `npx create-dumpsterfire-app --purge`;

```php
<?php

$a = 'guguggu';

class ProvaHighlighting extends Stronzo
{
    private int $figoStoPacchetto = 4316;
}

?>
```

```js
document.location.href='gay';
